    abstract = "{An axisymmetric model is used that replaces the blades with hub-to-tip streamsurfaces and their main effects on the flow with blade force terms. Euler equations are solved by means of an upwind finite-volume scheme for a specified swirl distribution in the meridional blade regions. This quantity drives the spanwise distribution of specific work for rotors and the swirl adding/removing property for stators. The time-marching procedure includes an evolutionary equation for the hub-to-tip geometry in each blade region. This equation involves use of a specified leading edge as a blade stacking line. Throughout the computation, the streamsurfaces take that shape providing the desired swirl distribution. The method is suitable to highly loaded blades i.e. turbine design. Compared to a traditional through-flow method, it predicts the overall turbine performances with about a 1\\% error. A satisfactory agreement is found concerning the spanwise distribution of the core flow quantities as well.}",
